Randahl opened his shop in Chicago in 1914 but soon closed it in order to join the war effort. The storefront reopened after the war and continued to operate until 1965. Unlike many of the craftsmen represented here, who exclusively produced hand-wrought silver through the 1940s, Randahl switched to producing mostly machine-made objects in the 1920s. Adopting machine technology earlier than his peers meant that Randahl could devote his time to experimenting with new designs.

The Industrial Revolution of the mid-19th century, and its resultant improvements in packing and shipping, facilitated the importation of tea and broadened its appeal to all social classes. During the early 20th century, silver tea sets became popular household items for the newly wealthy because they showed one’s improved financial status. In the later years of the Arts and Crafts period, when this tea set was made, the different items of a tea service were available for purchase separately.

Applied monograms are seen on many of the objects in this display case. The applied technique involves cutting out a separate shape in silver, which is then soldered on to the object.

Nicknamed the “Kalo girls,” they were responsible for designing the items produced, while Scandinavian immigrants fabricated them. The Kalo Shop thus offered opportunities for women and immigrants not found elsewhere in Chicago at the time.
The Kalo Shop produced the widest ranges of handmade holloware, jewelry, and flatware in Chicago during the Arts and Crafts movement, but during World War I, their production changed. Silver became scarce, and many of Kalo’s silversmiths were sent overseas to fight in the war. The female employees of the Kalo Shop started producing smaller items and jewelry, enabling the shop to stay open during the war.

He eventually created a limited home collection starting in 1986, which included these serving pieces. Intertwined vines and grapes leaves, seen here, decorate all the objects in his home collection. He created the naturalistic foliage and beetle from molds from specimens found in his garden. Dweck considers giving new life to old styles his specialty.

The Lily of the Valley pattern references the floral designs of Japanese paintings and woodblock prints. The company was founded in 1866 in Attleboro, Massachusetts by William Dean Whiting. After a fire in 1875, the factory was moved to New York City, where it became one of the leading producers of sterling silver flatware, hollowware, and other decorative objects. The use of Japanese-inspired designs was a way to set Whiting apart from its main competitors, Gorham Manufacturing Company and Tiffany & Company. Unfortunately, this strategy was not successful in keeping the company afloat. Gorham acquired the company in 1924 but continued to make silver under the Whiting name until 1926.",N0213

It wasn’t until he married Helen Rebecca Blanchard, daughter of the famous Arts and Crafts silversmith Porter Blanchard, that he became the apprentice to his father-in-law.

A professor of architecture at Tulane University, Spratling was an early promoter of Mexican artists, such as Diego Rivera, in the United States. He moved to Taxco, Mexico in 1926 and began experimenting with silver because of the silver mines located there. He started to design jewelry in 1931, quickly gaining recognition and opening a workshop by 1933. At the peak of his success, he had around 400 silversmiths working in his shop. Spratling was adding ten new designs a week during 1939–40, but his workshop ceased production in 1946 due to over-expansion. He continued to design silver for other workshops until his death in 1967.",N0116
